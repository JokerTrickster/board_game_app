## 🚀 Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Epics 1 & 2) - 4 weeks
**Priority:** Critical → High
1. Start with **Epic 1 (MVVM Architecture)** - Establishes architectural foundation
2. Parallel start **Epic 2 (Module Organization)** after Epic 1 Task 1.1 completion
3. Both epics can run partially in parallel as modules are being organized

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Epics 3 & 4) - 6 weeks  
**Priority:** High → Medium
1. Start **Epic 3 (Component System)** after module organization is stable
2. **Epic 4 (Code Structure)** can run in parallel with Epic 3
3. Focus on quality and consistency improvements

### Dependencies
- Epic 2 depends on Epic 1 (Task 1.1) for MVVM infrastructure
- Epic 3 depends on Epic 2 (Tasks 2.1-2.4) for module structure
- Epic 4 can run independently but benefits from other epics' progress

### Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental migration** to avoid breaking changes
- **Feature flags** for gradual rollout
- **Performance monitoring** throughout refactoring
- **Comprehensive testing** at each phase

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### Code Quality Improvements
- **70% Memory Reduction** (from Week 4 performance work)
- **60% Component Duplication Reduction** 
- **50% Component Count Reduction**
- **95% Code Consistency Score**
- **0 Import Cycles**

### Developer Experience
- **Faster Navigation** - Clear module boundaries
- **Consistent Patterns** - Standardized approaches
- **Better Testing** - MVVM enables unit testing business logic
- **Improved Documentation** - Comprehensive usage guides

### Maintainability
- **Clear Separation of Concerns** - MVVM pattern
- **Modular Architecture** - Independent feature modules
- **Reusable Components** - Design system approach
- **Automated Quality** - ESLint/Prettier enforcement
